# about-me
Hello, I'm Anna. 

I'm a student of Hillel computer academy and I'm studing a front-end development. It's exiting process but sometimes seems to be very hard. So you need to make great efforts to do some easy stuffs.

I hope that after this course I'll feel more confident in programming and will have enough knowledge to receive an offer.
